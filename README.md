# Corruption in Latin America

This project looks at corruption (specifically relating to bribery of public officials, kickbacks in public procurement, and embezzlement of public funds) across Latin American countries on a yearly scale using the Corruption Perception Index.

## About the project
Growing up in Peru, the concept of corruption wasn't an unfamiliar aspect of my life. Bribes were especially prominent among police officers in my small town, and the lack of data and attention to this problem inspired me to pursue this project. The datasets, although small, provide interesting insights to the levels of corruption in countries across Latin America.
